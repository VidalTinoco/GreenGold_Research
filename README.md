## ✨ Project summary

> **Research question**
> Did Michoacán’s 2011 access to the U.S. avocado market—often dubbed the *green-gold boom*—lower or widen wage inequality in producing municipalities?

Using a balanced panel of 113 municipalities (2003-2020), the study:

* Builds monthly Gini coefficients from Mexican Social Security (IMSS) wage registers.
* Implements a two-way fixed-effects Difference-in-Differences (DiD) design, with an event-study for parallel-trend diagnostics.
* Finds that avocado-growing municipalities are consistently more unequal, but the boom itself has **no statistically-significant causal effect** on formal-wage inequality after controlling for municipal and year fixed effects.
* Discusses why informal earnings caps, market power of <100 certified packers, and organized-crime shocks may obscure distributional gains.
